# PROGRAM PURPOSE: DISPLAY THE RESULTS CENTERED WITH SEPARATOR LINES, USING F-STRINGS AND THE STRING .CENTER() METHOD

LINE_WIDTH = 95  # width used for centering and separator length

# INPUT: gather details from the user with \n after to have input prompt on a fresh line
full_name = input("Enter your first and last name:\n")

sentence4 = f"The dream job is to obtain is {dream_job}."

# OUTPUT: print a separating line before and after, and center the sentences
separator = "=" * LINE_WIDTH
print(separator)
print(sentence1.center(LINE_WIDTH))
print(sentence2.center(LINE_WIDTH))
print(sentence3.center(LINE_WIDTH))
print(sentence4.center(LINE_WIDTH))
print(separator)
